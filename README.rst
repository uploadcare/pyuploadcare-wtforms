Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pyuploadcare-wtforms

Usage
-----

Package provides several fields for ``WTForms`` which made integration with Uploadcare little more easily:

* ``FileWidget``
* ``FileField``
* ``ImageField`` - you can set manual cropping for uploaded images
* ``FileGroupField``

In common case for usage you need:

* Use one of these fields in your form like this:

.. code:: python

    # your_app/forms.py

    from wtforms import Form
    from pyuploadcare_wtforms import ImageField

    class YourSuperForm(Form):
        image = ImageField(manual_crop='200x200')
        ...

* Set up keys:

.. code:: python

    # your_project_config.py
    from pyuploadcare import conf

    conf.pub_key = 'demopublickey'
    conf.secret = 'demoprivatekey'


* Put script to `your templates <https://uploadcare.com/quick_start/>`_:

.. code:: html

    <script src="https://ucarecdn.com/widget/2.5.5/uploadcare/uploadcare.full.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Look at `that simplest example <https://github.com/uploadcare/pyuploadcare-wtforms/tree/master/example>`_ for getting quick start. You can easily install it locally by:
